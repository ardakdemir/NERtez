# Named Entity Recognition in Turkish Using Deep Learning Models and Joint Learning

This page describes the work done in the Ms.Thesis by Arda Akdemir. The main aim of this page is to provide a framework for reproducing the work done in our Thesis conveniently.

Contributions planned:

* Dependency parser output as feature to ML model
  - Output of pretrained model and train on our own training set with [jPTDP](https://github.com/datquocnguyen/jPTDP) but need labels.
  * Joint learning of dependency parsing together with ML
  - We need a gold labeled data for dependency parser
* Combining various ML methods with Adaboost or some other boosting algorithm
* Extensive analysis of all frequently used ML methods
* Analysis of the problems and limitations related to the available dataset
