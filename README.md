# Named Entity Recognition for Turkish using ML methods

Contributions planned:

* Dependency parser output as feature to ML model
  - Output of pretrained model and train on our own training set with [jPTDP](https://github.com/datquocnguyen/jPTDP) but need labels.
  * Joint learning of dependency parsing together with ML
  - We need a gold labeled data for dependency parser
* Combining various ML methods with Adaboost or some other boosting algorithm
* Extensive analysis of all frequently used ML methods
* Analysis of the problems and limitations related to the available dataset
